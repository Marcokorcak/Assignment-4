# Assignment-4
In this assignment we created a web page that implemented mutliple features. The features were created by using a scrip JavaScript file and a style sheet written in CSS. The features are as follows:

* Two buttons are created. When one button is clicked, the text "I'm right" is placed next to it. When the other button is clicked, the text is replaced with, "No, I'm right!"
* A large element on the page that says "Don't hover over me" inside of it. When you hover over the element, the user receives the alert: "Hey, I told you not to hover over me!"
* A form that includes inputs for a username, email, and password, as well as a submit button. The form:
* Checks that the password is 12345678.
* If the password is incorrect, an alert message is displayed.
* If the message is correct, a heading message is displayed.
